# Unity Car Demo
A raycast based car physics demo based on the model described by Toyful Games in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdPYlj5uZeI) 
describing their technique used for their game, Very Very Valet. The car in this demo uses approximately the same configuration as they
described for their sedan, and differs mainly in that the force calculations are calculated in each individual wheel, providing
a far more flexible system that can accomodate any number and placement of wheels.
